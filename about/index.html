            <h2>About June</h2>
            <br>
            <img src="/img/me.jpg" />

            <p>
                Long established as one of Ireland's top comic performers, June Rodgers has regularly appeared on TV, in films and the full range of stage productions from musical theatre to pantomime.
            </p>

            <p>
                Born in Tallaght, County Dublin, when it was still a sleepy rural village, June attended St Patrick's Cathedral Grammar School in the Liberties of Dublin.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since first coming to prominence in John Player Tops, June has become a household name and a great favourite of young and old alike. Film work includes Agnes Browne with Angelica Houston, On the Nose with Robbie Coletraine and One Step Back starring Patrick Bergin and Brendan O'Carroll. She has just finished filming with Brendan in Mrs Brown D'Movie, which hits our cinema screens in June.
            </p>

            <p>
                Her TV work include a guest appearance in the 2009 series of the RTE medical drama The Clinic. June also hosted a radio programme on the history of variety theatre on the RTE radio documentary series Different Stages. She has also appeared many times on the Late Late Show, and has even been brave enough to be a guest of Podge and Rodge. More recently she has become a regular guest on Joe Duffy's "Funny Fridays" on Liveline.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a cabaret artist June has starred in her own show for a number of highly successful seasons at the Moran Silver Springs and Red Cow Hotels. She has extensively toured the U.S. and has featured her range of crazy characters in a number of live and studio CD recordings and on DVD. Her latest DVD "The Name is Bond... Oliver Bond" is available at her live shows and can be purchased in <a href="/store/">the online store</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The theatre stage is, however, June's first love. She took a leading role for six successive seasons in Ireland's premier pantomime at the Gaiety Theatre and then moved to the Olympia for the productions of Cinders and Jack and the Beanstalk. She gave a hilarious performance in the stage musical version of The Full Monty at the Olympia Theatre and on tour, and played the part of Edith in the Pirates of Penzance at the Helix.
            </p>

            <p>
                She made a guest appearance in the Hallelujah Chorus at The Point, and has guested regularly with Billie Barry Stage School shows at the Gaiety Theatre.
            </p>

            <p>
                June lives in a beautiful old stone cottage in Firhouse in South Dublin with her husband Peter Lane and their three dogs. To relax, she greatly enjoys gardening and walking the dogs.
